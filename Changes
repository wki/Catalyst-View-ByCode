        2011-01-02

        * added more tests
        
0.13    2010-12-09
        * increased version number due to a CPAN upload problem
        
0.12    2010-12-08
        * complete rewrite of the whole rendering code
          using simple structures instead of Moose for performance
          changed speed for readability

        2010-06-30
        * changed some parts of markup generation to inline code for speedup

0.11    2010-04-06
        * changed parameters transfered from process() to render() as
          actions with :Args() fail otherwise

        2010-04-08
        * added documentation

        2010-04-15
        * $VERSION is now generated from Dist::Zilla 
        
        2010-05-27
        * added a rudimentary html5 doctype

0.10    2010-04-01
        * bumped MooseX::AttributeHelpers to Version 0.23, as 0.22 fails
          Thanks, CPAN Testers!
        * tried Dist::Zilla as a packaging system -- looks much easier to use.
        * split up the process() method into render() and delivery to allow
          my $html = $c->forward('View::ByCode', render => [qw(list of files)]);
          without pollution of stash.
        
        2010-03-31
        * added a handy shortcut for checked, disabled, multiple, readonly
          and selected attributes rendering a true value to the 
          attribute's name
          eg: disabled => 1 will become disabled="disabled" in HTML
        * added a params() sub that allows to specify a series of
          param tags with one call.
        
        2010-03-29
        * fixed a bug that made block-definitions defined in 'old-scholl'
          fashion unable to read attr()-values. Only declare-defined
          blocks could read attr()-values.
          Added a test to verify the improvement.
          Bug reported by Phil Soehnlein
        * added a yield-test

0.09    2010-03-27

0.08    2010-03-27
        * eliminated trunk/ directory
        * moved to Module::Install
        * fixed a test that failed on Windows because path separator
          was hard coded and wrong for this platform
        
0.07    2010-03-13
        * docs added, first CPAN upload

        * updated META.yml, MANIFEST
        * added some docs
        
        2010-03-02
        * added test for mixedCase and combined_name attribute keys
        * fixed doc typos, expanded docs
        * added logic to expand and shrink class names instead of setting them
          class 'abc';  # sets a class name, is now: 'abc'
          class '+xxx'; # adds class names,  is now: 'abc xyz'
          class '-xxx'; # removes things,    is now: 'abc'
          class 'uuu';  # set a name         is now: 'uuu'
          class '+a selected'                is now: 'a selected uuu'
          class '-a' 'uuu'                   is now: 'selected'
          class '-selected +hui foo'         is now: 'foo hui'
        
        2010-03-09
        * Ã­ntroduced stringification in Document for tag-content objects
        * used OUT/RAW/STDOUT in Renderer to avoid 'possible typo' warnings
        
0.05    2010-02-23
        * fixed a bug that made certain multiline prototype-like attributes fail
        * added a test to verify that
        * allow to use special attribute-names like
          div(dataTarget => 'x')       becomes <div data-target="x">
          div(data_target => 'x')      becomes <div data-target="x">
          div(style => {zIndex => 9})  becomes <div style="z-index:9">

        2010-03-01
        * found a way to correctly export and Devel::Declare'able
          all defined block()s into importing namespaces
          the mechanics behind this is dark magic overwriting import()

0.04    2009-08-12
        * started rewriting the markup engine using Moose
        * defining main sub with template {...}; now
        * allow creation of blocks like block some_name => {...};
        * block_content() sub for renderung block's coderef
        * attr() is getter and setter now
        * tests for most modules

0.03    2009-07-18
        * expanded markup syntax by using some Devel::Declare tricks
        * corrected dependencies in Build.PL

0.02    2009-04-26
        added C::Helper::View::ByCode to allow create-script to work.

0.01    2009-04-25
